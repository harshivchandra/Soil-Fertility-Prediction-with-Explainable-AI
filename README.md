# Soil Fertility Prediction with Explainable AI

This repository contains the codebase for predicting soil fertility using supervised machine learning models, alongside the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret the model's decision-making process.

This work is based on my published research in IEEE Access:
- ðŸ“„ [Explainable AI for Soil Fertility Prediction (IEEE Access 2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239153)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

- ðŸ“‚ [Explainable AI for Soil Fertility Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshivchandra/explainable-ai-for-soil-fertility-prediction)



### Dataset Description
The dataset includes soil sample records with the following types of features:
- **Chemical Properties**: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, pH value, Organic Carbon content
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
- **Fertility Labels**: Categorical soil fertility ratings

The data has been cleaned, normalized, and mapped into relative classes to enhance training performance for machine learning models.



### Dataset Files
- `OriginalSoilDataset.csv`: Raw feature data and fertility labels
- `relativesoillabels.csv`: Label mapping for fertility categories
- `datalabelsforparams.csv`: Feature name references for dataset columns



### License
This dataset is sourced from the LUCAS 2018 TopSoil Dataset, ESDAC, European Commission.
